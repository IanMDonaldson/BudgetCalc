If we use a simple sum to stop inserting the same pdf twice
    - same pdf - sum will work because the pdf is the exact same
    - different pdf (new month)
        - chance of the first entry of the new pdf matching the desription, date, amount, and balance of the first entry of the old
            is impossible since they're a month apart, they can though
            have the same amount, balance, description, but not the date so we're good there
TODO add functions in the Database Insertion functions to check if the values in the provided
    pdf-extracted table match those in the table from the database query

TODO need to update every single transaction with the new sum
TODO Store the non-clean description in the transaction table, while cleaning it in the trans-class and class tables
    - to get more fine grained description output and more unique descriptions to validate if same pdf inserted twice




todo close program and open the excel sheet after generating csv
todo output to google sheets
