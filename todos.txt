TODO calculate balances in the rare occasion that there exists two identical transaction descriptions, for the same amount on the same day
    Like sending 10 dollars to multiple people on Zelle because we cut the description down to non-unique values :)
    TODO Could get around this by storing the raw descriptions in the Transaction Table
        Then when inserting into the Classification Table we run it through the clean description function!..seems like a better solution..don't really wanna determine balance unless I want
        to have a function to check whether the DB matches the statements
            - To check whether the DB matches the statement balances, we would have to determine the bank transfers and payments from checking/CC or transfers from checking/Savings..


todo close program and open the excel sheet after generating csv
todo output to google sheets
